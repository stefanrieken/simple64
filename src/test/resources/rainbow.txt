; this prints the rainbow one 256-wide block at the time

; store start address of screen memory
; at zero-page $30-$31 (randomly chosen)

lda #$00
sta $30
lda #$02
sta $31


; start with color black and increment from there
; there are only 16 colors, but the overflow doesn't matter
; Good, because A also doubles as our index for the 256-wide block
